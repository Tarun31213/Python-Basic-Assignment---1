1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 
'hello'
-87.8
- 
/ 
+	
6 
# Ans.1:- 'hello' , -87.7 , 6 are the vaalues
        # - , / , + , * are the expression 
2. what is the difference between string and variable ?
# Ans.2:- String:- all the variables and constants under paranthesis[""] are known as 'STRING'
        # Variable:- the alphabetic character that expresses a numerical value or a number
3. Describe three different data types ?
# Ans.3:- 'int' :- all integers comes under 'int' data-type
       # 'float' :- all decimal and complex numbers comes under 'float' data-type
       # 'str' :- all the variables or alphabets comes under 'str' data-type
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?     
# Ans.4:- Expressions are made up of 'Terms' which are represented by unknown variables,constants and coefficients. It is used to evaluate to a single value
5.This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
# Ans.5:-  Statements do something while expressions are representation of value
6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
# Ans.6:- 23
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
# Ans.7:- 'spamspamspam'
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
# Ans.8:- because eggs is an variable of alphabets whereas , 100 is numerical 
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
# Ans.9:- str() , int() , float()
10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
# Ans.10:- Because two dissimilar data-types cannot be concatenated in order to concatenate it needs to be done type-casting
